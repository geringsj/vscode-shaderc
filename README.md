# Shaderc Linter

This extension uses shaderc to lint and compile GLSL to SPIRV. The aim is to provide a nice way to edit, lint, and compile GLSL shaders that use the #include directive targeted at Vulkan, but it may work for other purposes. It also compiles GLSL to SPIRV and allows you to configure an output path for the output SPIRV files.

You will need a copy of the glslc executable/binary, which is available pre-built in the [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/), or on [github](https://github.com/google/shaderc)

Commands to Build and Build All are made available when you are editing glsl files. These commands will export the compiled SPIRV result from shadrec to a configurable directory. 'Build All' will attempt to export SPIRV for all currently opened glsl files. Note that Build All does not build every glsl file in the workspace, only those which have been opened.

## Extension Settings

Shaderc Linter offers the following settings:

- `shaderc-lint.glslcPath`: (required) Set this to the path of the glslc executable on your system
- `shaderc-lint.glslcArgs`: Additional arguments for the glslc executable
- `shaderc-lint.shadercOutputDir`: Output directory for compiled shaders. By default .spv files will be saved alongside your glsl files.
- `shaderc-lint.outputSPVOnSave` : Output SPV files every save. Enable this if you want to output SPV files every time you save a glsl file. Otherwise, you will need to use the Build command to output the compiled SPIRV shader.
- `shaderc-lint.includeSupport`: Added support for #include. This treats linker errors generated by files with a missing entry point as a warning only. You will also need to specify defaultGLSLVersion to supress linting errors with included files.
- `shaderc-lint.defaultGLSLVersion`: Passed to glslc with -std=. Assigns the GLSL version. Overwrites #version directives, gives a warning if they don't match.
