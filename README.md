# Shaderc Linter

This extension uses shaderc to lint GLSL (and probably HLSL, not tested yet). It's aim is to lint GLSL shaders that use the #include directive targeted at Vulkan, but it may work for other purposes. It also compiles GLSL to SPIRV and allows you to configure an output path for the output SPIRV files.

You will need a copy of the glslc executable/binary, which is available pre-built in the [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/), or on [github](https://github.com/google/shaderc)

By default .frag and .vert files will be linted.

## Extension Settings

Shaderc Linter offers the following settings:

- `shaderc-lint.glslcPath`: (required) Set this to the path of the glslc executable on your system
- `shaderc-lint.glslcArgs`: Additional arguments for the glslc executable
- `shaderc-lint.shadercOutputDir`: Output directory for compiled shaders. By default .spv files will be saved alongside your glsl files.
- `shaderc-lint.outputSPV` : Output SPV files. Disable this if you want linting only, with no spv file generation.
- `shaderc-lint.includeSupport`: Added support for #include. This treats linker errors generated by files with a missing entry point as a warning only. You will also need to specify defaultGLSLVersion to supress linting errors with included files.
- `shaderc-lint.defaultGLSLVersion`: Passed to glslc with -std=. Assigns the GLSL version. Overwrites #version directives, gives a warning if they don't match.
